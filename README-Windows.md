### Electrum-Sibcoin - lightweight multi-coin client
Electrum-Sibcoin provides a basic SPV wallet for Sibcoin. It is a BIP-0044-compliant wallet based on the original Electrum for Bitcoin. This Electrum-Sibcoin client uses Electrum servers to retrieve necessary blockchain headaer & transaction data, so no "Electrum-Sibcoin server" is necessary.

Because of the Simplified Payment Verification nature of the wallet, services requiring Masternode communications, such as DarkSend and InstantX are not available.
