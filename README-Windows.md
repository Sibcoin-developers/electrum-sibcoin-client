### Electrum-SIB - lightweight multi-coin client
Electrum-SIB provides a basic SPV wallet for Sibcoin. It is a BIP-0044-compliant wallet based on the original Electrum for Bitcoin. This Electrum-SIB client uses Electrum servers to retrieve necessary blockchain headaer & transaction data, so no "Electrum-SIB server" is necessary.

Because of the Simplified Payment Verification nature of the wallet, services requiring Masternode communications, such as DarkSend and InstantX are not available.
